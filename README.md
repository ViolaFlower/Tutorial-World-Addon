**This requires the Legacy4J mod.**

This is a small add-on that was originally a part of [Re-Console Resources](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/re-console-resources), which was now seperated into this resource pack to allow people to use the Tutorial Worlds without the Resources pack being required.

Feel free to use in any modpacks, no credit required
